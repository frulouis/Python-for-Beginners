# Case: Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0) 

# Example: 
# If the following n is given as input to the program: 
# 5 
# Then, the output of the program should be: 
# 3.55



n=int(input("Enter a number: "))

sum=0.0

for i in range (1,n+1):
    sum+=float(float(i)/(i+1))
print(sum)
